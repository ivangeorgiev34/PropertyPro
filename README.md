In the application there are 2 roles:
- Landlord
- Tenant

Both roles have a individual user profile which they can edit.
### Landlord
They can post their properties and edit information about it or delete it, however they cannot edit or delete reviews that are left under his property. The tenants in the system can only view the property, book it, or leave a review under it.
### Tenant
They can book properties that exist in the system, only if the start and end dates interval is not busy already for the given property. Also they can leave reviews for the property, which is rated throough a star scale. They cannot create properties, nor edit or delete a property.
